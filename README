AcCoRuTe - Access Control Rules Tester
========================================================================================
This project aims to create tool that automates the process of finding 
access control flaws in web applications.


HISTORY
========================================================================================
The first version of the tool was created by Andrew Petukhov <petand@lvk.cs.msu.su> 
as his GSoC'08 work for OWASP project. 
See http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Access_Control_Rules_Tester_Project


THEORY
========================================================================================
The underlying theory was first proposed by Andrew Petukhov <petand@lvk.cs.msu.su> 
and then reviewed and improved by George Noseevich as the part of a term paper.
Detailed explaination should appear within the project documentation once the codebase 
grows mature enough.


PROJECT STRUCTURE
========================================================================================
The current version under development is being built from scratch (though borrowing some
code and ideas from the first version) and aims to overcome drawbacks of the first 
version.

The tool consists of 2 major parts: 

 * Web application markup helper, written as a FireFox extension.
 * Web application Access Control engine tester, a standalone Java application.
