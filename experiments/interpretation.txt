This folder contains the results of practical evaluation 
of the AcCoRuTe toolset.

Each subfolder contains a full report for some web application, 
which consists of:
 * README.txt , which contains info about the web application itself, 
   its known vulnerabilities, etc.
 * usecases.png , the UseCase diagram (solid black arrows mean dependency, 
   dashed red arrows mean cancellation)
 * report.xml , the main output of scanner tool, which describes the selected
   sequence of usecases and lists spikes found at each step
 * <webappname>-capture.txt , t6he output of the mapper tool
 * sitemaps, which is a directory, containing graphical representation
   of sitemaps, named <UCnum><UCname>_<role>_<num>, where UCnum and UCname 
   are number and name of performed UseCase, role is the role of user for which
   the sitemap is gathered, and num is 1 or 2, as we need 2 users of each role
   to perform horisontal priviledge escalation tests

== How to read sitemaps ==
 * Big dark dots are web pages. 
 * Record-style square vertices are actions.
   The first field of the record describes action from HTTP viewpoint, and next 
   ones - from the DOM action viewpoint (as a series of clicks, mouse movements etc).
 * Edges connect web pages to other web pages through actions
 * Three special nodes exist - the initial state, from which the first request is made,
   invalid node, where all actions are connected that lead to error pages, or are out of scope,
   or cause session invalidation etc; and the change state node, which is the sink for all actions
   that were not performed during sitemap building as they would have been changed the state.
